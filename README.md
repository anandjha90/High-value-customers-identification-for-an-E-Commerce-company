# High-value-customers-identification-for-an-E-Commerce-company
DESCRIPTION

Background of Problem Statement:
A UK-based online retail store has captured the sales data for different products for the period of one year (Nov 2016 to Dec 2017). The organization sells gifts primarily on the online platform.The customers who make a purchase consume directly for themselves.There are small businesses that buy in bulk and sell to other customers through the retail outlet channel.

Project Objective:
Find significant customers for the business who make high purchases of their favourite products.The organization wants to roll out a loyalty program to the high-value customers after identificationof segments. Use the clustering methodology to segment customers into groups:

Domain: E-commerce

Dataset Description:
This is a transnational dataset that contains all the transactions occurring between Nov-2016 to Dec-2017 for a UK-based online retail store.

 Attribute	Description
 InvoiceNo	Invoice number (A 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction)
 StockCode	Product (item) code
 Description 	Product (item) name
 Quantity 	The quantities of each product (item) per transaction
 InvoiceDate	The day when each transaction was generated
 UnitPrice	Unit price (Product price per unit)
 CustomerID	Customer number (Unique ID assigned to each customer)
 Country	Country name (The name of the country where each customer resides)
 
 Analysis tasks to be performed: 
 Use the clustering methodology to segment customers into groups:
 Use the following clustering algorithms:

K means
Hierarchical

• Identify the right number of customer segments.
• Provide the number of customers who are highly valued.
• Identify the clustering algorithm that gives maximum accuracy and explains robust clusters.
• If the number of observations is loaded in one of the clusters, break down that cluster further using the clustering   algorithm. 
[ hint: Here loaded means if any cluster has more number of data points as compared to other clusters then split that clusters by increasing the number of clusters and observe, compare the results with previous results.]
